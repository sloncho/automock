// Here there be dragons...

// So as not to have to reimplement the logic that's in proxyquire, we simply
// take it as a dependency.  But proxyquire is cleverly authored such that
// the function you get back from `require('proxyquire')` isn't actually a
// Proxyquire object... it's an instance of the `Proxyquire.load()` function,
// with Proxyquire's prototype functions bound to it as properties.  This means
// that it's incredibly difficult to inject new behavior into the middle of the
// returned object.
//
// However, since Proxyquire is already playing tricks with Node's built-in
// module logic, there's no reason we can't play similar tricks on Proxyquire
// itself.  Rather than requiring the top-level proxyquire export, we use
// knowledge of Proxyquire's innards so that we can directly acquire the
// Proxyquire class, which allows us to override individual function properties
// as needed.

// find the location of the proxyquire module, and then get the implementation
// directly.

// it returns a pre-bound `Proxyquire.load()` that is hard-wired to the containing

// We can, however, define our own subclass and ignore the return value from the
